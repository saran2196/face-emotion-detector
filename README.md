The Human Face Emotion Detector is a deep learningâ€“based computer vision project that detects human emotions in real time using a webcam feed.
It uses OpenCV for face detection and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying emotions into categories such as Angry, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

âœ¨ Features
	â€¢	Real-time face detection and emotion classification
